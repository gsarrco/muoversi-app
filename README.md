# Muoversi App

Muoversi is a mobile public transit app, interface of the [muoversi-server](https://github.com/gsarrco/muoversi-server), for displaying timetables and routes for busses and waterbusses in Venice, Italy (Actv), and trains within 100km from Venice (Trenitalia). However, it is designed to be easily extensible to other cities and transit companies in the future.

It is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). It is under development and not yet available on any app store.
